# @bridge-tools/core

`@bridge-tools/core` is an open-source library written in Typescript. It is designed to simplify the process of writing bridge software. The types and functions provided form the fundamentals to allow a Typescript bridge platform to be built quickly, with less initial effort.

The idea of `@bridge-tools/core` came from libraries designed for other games, such as [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js).

# Features

-   Types for cards, bids, boards and more
-   Conversion to and from strings
-   Score calculation
-   Functions for checking validity of auctions and cardplay
-   Functions for evaluating tricks
-   100% unit test coverage
